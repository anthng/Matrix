# Matrix

This is a small assignment in the Object-oriented programming course which I have been learning in my university.

The target: Building a **Matrix class** from the **Vector template** (vector of vectors) with the methods:
  - Constructor, Copy Constructor, Destructor, Input and Output.
  - The operators +,-,*,/ between matrix and matrix, matrix and scalar, matrix and vector.
  - Finding the largest position of the matrix.
  ... (You are able to get more another methods, if you like)
  
My code have not still optimized yet. So, I hope that you can contribute to improve it better.

Thanks! 

## Environment:
  - **OS**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  - **Language**: C++
  - **IDE**: CodeLite
